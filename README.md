## Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Here is an example GitHub Actions workflow that you can use to run the GitHub Linear Sync action:

```yaml
name: Sync GitHub to Linear Project template

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Run every day at midnight

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Run the sync action
        input:
          linear_token: ${{ secrets.LINEAR_TOKEN }}
          linear_team_id: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
          linear_template_id: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
          project_folder: "./linear-template"
        run: npm run dev
```

This workflow will run the sync action on every push to the `main` branch and also on a daily schedule at midnight. Make sure to set the required environment variables in your GitHub repository secrets.

## Running Locally

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Set Environment Variables**: You can set the environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of the project. Create a `.env` file and add the following lines:

   ```plaintext
   LINEAR_TOKEN=your_linear_token
   LINEAR_TEAM_ID=your_linear_team_id
   LINEAR_TEMPLATE_ID=your_linear_template_id
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   ```

Make sure to replace `your_linear_token`, `your_linear_team_id`, and `your_linear_template_id` with your actual Linear API key, team ID, and template ID.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Run the app**: You can run the it using the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command will execute the `index.js` file, which should handle the synchronization process with the Linear project template.

4. **Linting**: To lint the code and fix any issues, use the following command:

```sh
npm run lint
```

This command will run the linter and automatically fix any fixable issues.
